### About

Computer programming is not a skill acquired by a uniformized learning path. It's called a task, a shore, a craft, a tool even an art to some,

People need it for a few lines, others lead a lifetime making a living at it. Some are taught it by their parents in their quality time on the weekends very young. Others may only program an unexpected late stage second career switch after their way of making a living comes no longer tenable for one reason or the next.

All are **developers** with their life experience and specific knowledge to share.

The constraint of need, demand, and material are a conduit for making and sharing creative solutions; albeit a frustrating and lonely one at times

Problem solving when collaboratively we think together for [common good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good); [collective intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence) is the rising tide that lifts all boats.

> ***What is a galere*?***
> 
> In French there's an verb [*galérer*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/galérer#French) meaning informally to have a hard time, or be in tough position; all based on the original word [*galère*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/galère) – a galley ship, where people were condemned to forced labor rowing these ships. Therefore its not a big jump to understand how [synonmous](https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/galère) it is with misery struggling endlessly
> 
> Etymologically, in English its rarer but [holds the quivalent meaning](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/galère), though adding "a group of people having a common interest, especially a coterie of undesirable people" interestingly.
