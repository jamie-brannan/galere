# Release Pull Request

At all times there should be a `develop` branch that points to `main` with it's own merge request, named with `<version number> Release` next to it.

It's **description** should be filled with the release github pull request template. Then any other releavant specifications to that release written out.

Releasing requires:

- [ ] Create this pull request (PR) of `develop` pointing to `main` if this has not already been done
- [ ] **Next**, `git pull` the `develop` branch `origin` to ensure the commits of the corresponding version number release milestone issue.
- [ ] **Update** the build number in Xcode (use `bin/generate_build_number.sh`)
- [ ] **Update** the version number in Xcode (âš  Watch out for differences between "marketing" version and current version numbers)
- [ ] **Update** the `README.md` with the specified version number
- [ ] Ensure all unit tests run locally. If more than a simple quick fix is required, make a new issue.
- [ ] Manually test the functionality of the application build on a real device, that it meets the expected release requirements found in the PR description and milestone issue inventory. Create new issues as needed
- [ ] Make only one commit of minor changes for the release as needed (update of `README.md` included)
- [ ] Ensure piplines and all reviews pass; and approvals have been granted on PR on github
- [ ] From cleared green-lit PR on github, create a merge commit with the name of the release (as cited above)
- [ ] [Git tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) the hash of this merge commit of the release with the specified release number

Following the release, kindly rebase create a new `develop` branch pull with the next specified release version number or simply `Release`
