///
/// This class is marked with the `final` keyword because we do not want it to be overriden nor subclassed, since we only have one launch screen for the app for now.
/// > For more about classes as reference types see related official Swift.org documentation: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/inheritance/
///
/// Therefore we need `@MainActor` on the `state` and for the `dismiss()` that'll mutate the state so that we're sure it stays on the main thread
